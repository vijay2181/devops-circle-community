ðŸ”¶ Jenkins Scenario-based Interview Questions ðŸ”¶ 
1.How would you create a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Java application?
2.Describe how you would implement a Jenkins pipeline using a `Jenkinsfile` stored in the source code repository.
3.How would you set up a Multibranch Pipeline to automatically create jobs for each branch in a Git repository?
4.How can you configure a Jenkins pipeline to run multiple stages in parallel?
5.How would you configure a Jenkins job to trigger a build based on changes in a Git repository?
6.Describe how you would set up a Jenkins job that accepts parameters from the user before running the build.
7.How would you configure Jenkins to send an email notification upon build completion, only if the build fails?
8.How can you archive and publish build artifacts in Jenkins for later use or download?
9.How do you securely manage and use credentials (such as API keys or SSH keys) within Jenkins jobs?
10.How would you pass and use environment variables within a Jenkins pipeline?
11.Describe how you would configure Jenkins to use multiple build agents for distributed builds.
12.How can you ensure that a particular job runs on a specific Jenkins agent or a group of agents?
13.How would you configure Jenkins to build and deploy Docker images?
14.A pipeline stage intermittently fails due to network issues. How would you add retry logic to handle such failures?
15.How would you identify and install necessary plugins for Jenkins to support a specific build tool or technology?
16.Describe how you would use Shared Libraries to reuse code across multiple Jenkins pipelines.
17.How can you manage user permissions and secure your Jenkins instance?
18.What strategy would you use to back up Jenkins configurations and jobs, and how would you restore them?
19.How would you visualize and monitor the progress of your Jenkins pipelines?
20.How can you integrate test reports (e.g., JUnit, NUnit) into Jenkins to display test results?
21.How do you configure Jenkins to automatically discover and run pipelines defined in source control?
22.What steps would you take to manage long-running jobs that might time out or exceed resource limits?
23.How would you set up a build promotion strategy in Jenkins to promote builds through different stages (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod)?
24.Describe how you would set up Jenkins to trigger builds based on GitHub pull requests.
25.How would you troubleshoot and debug a failing Jenkins pipeline?
26.How can you use Job DSL to automate the creation and configuration of Jenkins jobs?
27.How would you configure a matrix build in Jenkins to test an application across multiple environments or configurations?
28.What measures would you take to secure sensitive information within your Jenkins pipeline scripts?
